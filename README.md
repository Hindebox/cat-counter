# Cat Counter
This is not a simple counter

I could have built a sheep counter for aiding sleep but my purpose was to keep you awake and joyful.  
Aside from being beautiful and intelligent, cats are a boost for your health.  
Cats help decrease stress and improve your mood. This is the result of a rise in serotonin (feel good hormone) and a decrease in cortisol (stress hormone).   
Good feelings win!

⚠️**WARNING**: This counter is hypoallergenic!

### DESCRIPTION
This counter is a Vanilla JS project. Every element is created using Javascript except for the main container div. 

### FUNCTIONALITY
The main purpose is to increment and decrement a given value set to 0 using + and - buttons. You have the option to reset everything and return to the starting situation with the Reset button.  
  
But... I'm never satisfied.  
Thinking about the usefulness of this tool I wanted to give it some unique features. The theme is discussed in the introduction.  
Cats appear as the value increases. Listen carefully and you’ll hear meowing.  
If you decrement the value meows will be sad and this is the reason why you are forbidden to go below zero.  

### EVERYWHERE
The app is accessible from any device, so you can use it jokingly with friends or in a time of need at the office.  
If you are on the computer you can also use the keyboard +/- buttons or 'Canc' to reset.
